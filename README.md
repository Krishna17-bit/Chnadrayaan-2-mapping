# Chnadrayaan-2-mapping
# 🛰️ Chandrayaan-2 Mapping Project

This project focuses on analyzing and mapping data from the Chandrayaan-2 mission. The analysis is conducted using the data provided by the TMC (Terrain Mapping Camera) and other instruments on board the Chandrayaan-2 orbiter.

## 🌍 Overview

The main objectives of this project are:

- **Data Analysis**: To process and analyze the data captured by the Chandrayaan-2 orbiter, particularly focusing on lunar surface mapping.
- **Mapping**: To create detailed maps of the lunar surface based on the data.
- **Visualization**: To visualize the processed data for better understanding and interpretation.

## 📂 Repository Structure

- **`TMC_2_analysis.ipynb`**: Jupyter Notebook containing the analysis code for processing and visualizing the TMC data.
- **`data/`**: Directory containing raw and processed data files (ensure sensitive data is not publicly shared).
- **`results/`**: Directory where the output maps and visualizations are stored.
